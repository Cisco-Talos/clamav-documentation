# Installing ClamAV on Windows

Updated instructions for how to build ClamAV with CMake are coming soon. For now, please see [the `INSTALL.md` file](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/dev/0.104/INSTALL.md) located in the source repository.

If you wish to build ClamAV from source using the Visual Studio solution, please head over to the [Win32 ClamAV Build Instructions](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/dev/0.103/win32/README.md) located in our source release materials on [ClamAV.net](https://www.clamav.net/downloads) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav).
