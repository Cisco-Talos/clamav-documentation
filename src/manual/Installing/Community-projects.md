# Community Projects

> _Disclaimer_: The software listed in this section is authored by third parties and not by the ClamAV Team. Compatibility may vary.

## Signatures

The ClamAV Team provides FreshClam for ClamAV agents to update the official signature databases and provides [CVD-Update](https://pypi.org/project/cvdupdate/) for [Private Mirror](../../appendix/CvdPrivateMirror.md) administrators to update their server content.

Both FreshClam and CVD-Update have some limited features to update signatures from third-party sources but community tools exist that are designed for this purpose and provide a more complete experience for users that want the extra coverage.

> **WARNING**: While there are no known vulnerabilities in using traditional content-based and hash-based ClamAV signatures, bytecode signatures are a _different story_. Bytecode signatures are effectively cross-platform executable plugins [similar to Web Assembly (WASM)](../Development/Contribute.md#webassembly-runtime) but with less sandboxing.
>
> ClamScan and ClamD will not run unsigned bytecode signatures by default. Cisco-Talos' signing certificate is the **only** certificate trusted by ClamAV to run bytecode signatures.
>
> Both ClamD and ClamScan have options to run unsigned bytecode signatures but you should **NEVER** enable unsigned bytecode signatures in production when using signatures from third-party sources or a malicious bytecode signature author could gain control of your systems.
>
> ClamBC is a tool installed with ClamAV for testing bytecode signatures and should also **NEVER** be used to run signatures from an unknown or untrusted source.

### Fangfrish

Fangfrisch (German for "freshly caught") is a sibling of the Clam Anti-Virus FreshClam utility. It allows downloading virus definition files that are not official ClamAV canon, e.g. from [Sanesecurity](https://sanesecurity.com/), [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/) and others. Fangfrisch was designed with security in mind, to be run by an unprivileged user only.

[Detailed documentation](https://rseichter.github.io/fangfrisch/) is available online.

## Mail Filters

ClamAV is popular for filtering mail. The ClamAV Team maintains ClamAV-Milter, which is a filter for the Sendmail mail transfer agent and the ClamAV community have created a wide variety of other tools to use ClamAV with different mail transfer agents.

### Generic Mail Transfer Agents

#### amavisd-new | clamd, clamscan

amavisd-new is a high-performance interface between mailer (MTA) and content checkers: virus scanners, and/or SpamAssassin. It is written in Perl for maintainability, without paying a significant price for speed. It talks to MTA via (E)SMTP or LMTP, or by using helper programs. Best with Postfix, fine with dual-sendmail setup and Exim v4, works with sendmail/milter, or with any MTA as a SMTP relay. For Courier and qmail MTA integration there is a patch in the distributed package.

amavisd-new is a rewritten version of Amavis and is maintained by Mark Martinec.

ClamScan is enabled automatically if `clamscan` binary is found at amavisd-new startup time. ClamD is activated by uncommenting its entry in the `@av_scanners` list in the file `/etc/amavisd.conf`.

[Get amavisd-new](https://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/)

### Sendmail

#### MIMEDefang | clamscan, clamd

### Others

#### Mail Avenger | clamscan

[Mail Avenger](https://www.mailavenger.org/) is a highly-configurable SMTP server. It allows you to reject spam during mail transactions, before spooling messages in your local mail queue. You can specify site-wide default policies for filtering mail, but individual users can also craft their own policies by creating avenger scripts in their home directories.

[Get Mail Avenger](https://www.mailavenger.org/dist/)

#### MailScanner | clamscan

[MailScanner](https://www.mailscanner.info/) scans all e-mail for viruses, spam and attacks against security vulnerabilities.

#### Haraka | clamd

Haraka is a robust MTA written in node.js, with a modular architecture that lets plugins control nearly every aspect of the SMTP conversation. There is a large selection of included plugins, including a clamav plugin (docs, source) that filters messages [using clamd](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka/blob/master/docs/plugins/clamd.md).

Haraka is attractive to two audiences:

1. Anyone managing mail systems with thousands or tens-of-thousands of concurrent incoming SMTP connections (like Craigslist) and wants to do with it fewer racks of servers.

2. Developers who need more control over mail routing, filtering, and processing than can be easily or efficiently handled with traditional (milter-based) MTAs.

[Get Haraka](https://github.com/haraka/Haraka)

### Web & FTP Tools

#### Clammit | clamd

Clammit is a proxy that will perform virus scans of files uploaded via http requests, including multipart/form-data. If a virus exists, it will reject the request out of hand. If no virus exists, the request is then forwarded to the application and it's response returned in the upstream direction.

As the name implies, Clammit offloads the virus detection to the ClamAV virus detection server (clamd).

[Get Clammit](https://github.com/ifad/clammit)

#### Clara

- Based on libFUSE version 3 (until version 1.1.0 on libFUSE v2)
- Implements all clamd scan modes: fname, fdpass and stream
- Supports remote clamd instances in stream mode over TCP/IP socket
- Caches scan results in a LRU cache with time-based and out-of-memory expiration
- Configuration stored in XML files
- Supports ulockmgr
- Sends mails to administrator when detects virus

[Get ClamFS](https://github.com/burghardt/clamfs)

#### Avfs | ClamAV

Avfs, a true on-access anti-virus file system that incrementally scans files and prevents infected data from being committed to disk. Avfs is a stackable file system and therefore can add virus detection to any other file system: Ext3, NFS, etc. Avfs supports forensic modes that can prevent a virus from reaching the disk or automatically create versions of potentially infected files to allow safe recovery. Avfs can also quarantine infected files on disk and isolate them from user processes.

Avfs uses a matching algorithm that is derived from ClamAV but with changes to optimize scan time for larger signature sets. Though this project does not appear to be maintained or used elsewhere, the research was really good work and may inspire optimizations in ClamAV in the future.

[More about Avfs](https://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/docs/avfs-security04/index.html)

### Mail User Agents

#### Claws Mail

#### Open Webmail modules | clamscan

Open WebMail by default can use ClamAV as the external viruscheck module to scan messages fetched from pop3 servers or all incoming messages. If a message or its attachments is found to have virus, Open WebMail will move the message from INBOX to the VIRUS folder automatically.

[Get Open Webmail](https://openwebmail.org/)

## ClamAV Bindings

### Rust

#### clamav-rs | libclamav

#### PHP ClamAV Scan | clamd

A simple PHP class for scanning files using a LOCAL ClamAV/clamd install either via a socket file or network socket (windows). Can either be used on its own or dropped into a Codeigniter app as a library. The main reason this was created was because the legacy php-clamav module is not compatible with PHP 7 and all other options I found were either not drop in compatible with CodeIgniter or were designed for use with Composer.

[Get PHP ClamAV](https://github.com/kissit/php-clamav-scan)

### Python
