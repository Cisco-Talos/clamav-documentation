# Installing ClamAV

ClamAV is widely available on package managers for most operating systems. The ClamAV project also provides traditional installers and portable ZIP installations for Windows 32bit and 64bit systems.

If you need, you can also compile and install ClamAV *from source*:
- [Unix/Linux/Mac Instructions](Installing-from-source-Unix.md).
- [Windows Instructions](Installing-from-source-Windows.md).

## Installing From Packages

Installing your distribution's packages is the easiest route. It will make also upgrades easier.

### Understand which packages you need

Some distributions parcel up ClamAV components into separate packages. You don't necessarily need all of the packages. If you wish to install the bare minimum, then read the [ClamAV Overview](clamav-overview) carefully to understand which ones you will need.

* [RHEL/CentOS](#rhel)
* [Fedora](#fedora)
* [Mandriva](#mandriva)
* [Gentoo](#gentoo)

### Debian <a id="debian" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

```bash
  apt-get update
  apt-get install clamav
```

### RHEL/CentOS <a id="rhel" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

```bash
  yum install -y epel-release
  yum install -y clamav
  yum install -y clamd
```

On [Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS)] the ClamAV package requires the [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository].

On [RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)] the EPEL release package has to be installed either manually or through RHN.

### Fedora <a id="fedora" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

```bash
  yum install -y clamav clamav-update
```

### Mandriva <a id="mandriva" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

```bash
  urpmi clamav clamd
```

### Gentoo <a id="gentoo" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

```bash
  emerge clamav
```

See package entry on [Portage].

### openSUSE <a id="opensuse" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

```bash
  zypper install -y clamav
```

### FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD <a id="bsd" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

Althought all these systems offer the possibility to use ports or pkgsrc, you can install the pre-built package:

#### FreeBSD

```bash
  pkg install clamav
```

#### OpenBSD

```bash
  pkg_add clamav
```

#### NetBSD

```bash
  pkgin install clamav
```

### Solaris <a id="solaris" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

#### Solaris packages from [OpenCSW]

OpenCSW is a community software project for Solaris 8+ on both Sparc and x86. It packages more than 2000 popular open source titles and they can all easily be installed with dependency handling via _pkgutil_ which is modeled after Debian's _apt-get_.

```bash
  pkgutil -i clamav
```

### Slackware <a id="slackware" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

Martijn Dekker provides packages there that provide complete and semi-automatic integration with ClamAV's stock Sendmail package.

#### How to use

Download the package, and as root, install it like so (substituting the appropriate filename):

```bash
  installpkg clamav-0.91.2-i486-1McD.tgz
```

To activate Sendmail integration, after installing the package, copy the `/usr/share/sendmail/sendmail-slackware-clamav.cf` file into `/etc/mail/sendmail.cf`:

```bash
  cp /usr/share/sendmail/sendmail-slackware-clamav.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
```

Then start ClamAV and restart Sendmail:

```bash
  /etc/rc.d/rc.clamav start
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sendmail restart
```

#### Building Your Own Package

You may wish to build your own package if I haven't uploaded one with the most recent version yet, if you use a pre-11.0 Slackware version (at the time of this writing, I build on 11.0, 12.0 and 12.1, and my binaries may not work on earlier versions), if you don't trust third-party binaries, or simply because you're a complete geek ;-) . You can download my easy-to-use Slackbuild script, from which the fully-integrated ClamAV packages at Linuxpackages.net are generated.

This script can be used to build a ClamAV package for Slackware 10.0 or higher with Sendmail installed (as Sendmail milter support was introduced as of 10.0). To choose a version of ClamAV to build, you can `cd` to the script's directory and invoke the script like so:

```bash
  VERSION=1.23.4 ./clamav.SlackBuild
```

â€¦substituting, of course, the appropriate ClamAV version for `1.23.4`. Note: there is no need to be root to use this build script; it will ask for your root password after building the binaries and just before creating the package (and if you have fakeroot installed, even that isn't necessary).

### macOS <a id="macos" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

ClamAV can be easily installed on macOS using one of these popular package managers:
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): [ClamAV formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/clamav)
- [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php): [ClamAV port](https://ports.macports.org/port/clamav/summary)

#### Homebrew

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't already have it. Then run:

```bash
  brew install clamav
```

Homebrew installs versioned packages to `/usr/local/Cellar/<pacakge>/<version>` with symlinks in `/usr/local/opt/<pacakge>` to the current version. Symlinks for ClamAV's executables will be placed in `/usr/local/bin` to add them to your PATH. ClamAV's config files will be placed in `/usr/local/etc/clamav`.

As with most other installation methods, you may need to do the following at a minimum before you can run `freshclam`, `clamscan`, or use `clamdscan` with `clamd`:
1. Create `/usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf` from `/usr/local/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf.sample`.
2. Remove or comment-out the `Example` line from `freshclam.conf`
3. Run `freshclam` to download the latest malware definitions.

If you wish to run `clamd` you'll also need to create `/usr/local/etc/clamav/clamd.conf` from `/usr/local/etc/clamav/clamd.conf.sample`, and configure `clamd.conf` with Local/Unix socket settings (preferred), or TCP socket settings.

#### MacPorts

Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) if you don't already have it. Then run:

```bash
  sudo port install clamav
```

MacPorts installs versioned packages to `/opt/local/`. ClamAV's config files will be placed in `/opt/local/etc`.

As with most other installation methods, you may need to do the following at a minimum before you can run `freshclam`, `clamscan`, or use `clamdscan` with `clamd`:
1. Create `/opt/local/etc/freshclam.conf` from `/opt/local/etc/freshclam.conf.sample`.
2. Remove or comment-out the `Example` line from `freshclam.conf`
3. Run `freshclam` to download the latest malware definitions.

If you wish to run `clamd` you'll also need to create `/opt/local/etc/clamd.conf` from `/opt/local/etc/clamd.conf.sample`, and configure `clamd.conf` with Local/Unix socket settings (preferred), or TCP socket settings.

### Windows <a id="windows" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

Official ClamAV builds for Windows users are available [here](https://www.clamav.net/downloads#otherversions)

* `ClamAV-<version>.exe` - Traditional executable installer that will install ClamAV in the "Program Files" directory.
* `clamav-<version>-rc-win-x64-portable.zip` - Portable install package for 64-bit Windows systems.
* `clamav-<version>-rc-win-x86-portable.zip` - Portable install package for 32-bit Windows systems.

#### How to Install

* Simple mode: Double-click the EXE installer.
* Command line (for scripted installs): `powershell.exe ClamAV-<version>.exe /DIR="C:\Your\Install\Directory" /norestart /quiet /verysilent /LOG="clamav_install.log"`
* Portable (unzip): Unzip the portable install package of choice to any directory.

## What now?

Now that ClamAV is installed, you will want to customize your configuration and perhaps set up some scanning automation and alerting mechnisms.
