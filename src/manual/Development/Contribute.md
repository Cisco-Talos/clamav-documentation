## Bugs

There's only so much our core dev team can schedule into each release. Many bugs probably won't be fixed without your help! Feel free to troll our [open GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav-devel/issues) if you're looking for project ideas!

## Larger Projects

The following are a list of project ideas for someone looking to work on a larger project.
Any projects labeled "Risky" or "Exploratory" are thought to be more likely to fail, or to have significant drawbacks that will result in the new feature being ultimately rejected.

Please don't take it personally if the ClamAV team decide not to merge your implementation due to perceived complexity, stability, or other such concerns.

Contributors are expected to implement ample documentation for any new code or feature. Directions on how to test the contribution as well as unit and/or system tests will significantly help with PR review and will improve the likelihood that your contribution will be accepted.

Unstable or incomplete work is not likely to be accepted. The core development team has a long backlog of tasks and a curated roadmap for the next 6-12 months and will not have time to complete an unfinished project for you.

Contributors submitting a sizeable new feature will be asked to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before the contribution can be accepted.

### CMake: `-D MAINTAINER_MODE=ON`

The purpose of "maintainer" build-mode is to update source generated by tools like Flex, Bison, and GPerf which are not readily accessible on every platform.

In this case, the project is to add [GNU `gperf`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/manual/gperf.html) support to the our CMake build system's Maintainer-Mode (`-D MAINTAINER_MODE=ON`). To complete this task, you'll need to detect GPerf when using Maintainer-Mode, and it should be required. When the build runs, it should regenerate and overwrite the `libclamav/jsparse/generated` files in the source directory using `gperf` with `jsparse-keywords.gperf`.

The contributor should add the new option to `CMakeOptions.cmake` and document the feature in `INSTALL.cmake.md` as well as in the `clamav-faq` repo's `development.md` developer documentation, after the feature has merged.

**Category**: Low-hanging fruit, Development

**What you will learn from this project**:

- CMake C/C++ build system skills

**Required skills**:

- Linux/Unix familiarity. Familiarity with compiling C/C++ projects.

**Project Size**: Small

### CMake: `-D CODE_COVERAGE=ON`

Add a `-D CODE_COVERAGE=ON` option to the CMake build system which will build ClamAV with code coverage features enabled.

An ideal solution would support code coverage in when using GCC, Clang, and MSVC.

See `development.md` in the `clamav-faq` repo for additional insight on how `gcov`, `lcov`, and `genhtml` can be used today with the Autotools build system.

The contributor should add the new option to `CMakeOptions.cmake` and document the feature in `INSTALL.cmake.md` as well as in the `clamav-faq` repo's `development.md` developer documentation, after the feature has merged.

### Develop New Detection Capabilities for PE/ELF/MachO Executables

ClamAV parses the PE/ELF/MachO headers on executables that it scans, but doesn't make all of the data that it extracts available for use by NDB/LDB signatures. Some features that would be great to have include:

- The ability to distinguish between regular executables and DLLs/SOs/DYLIBs (add new keywords?)
- Subsignature modifiers that can limit subsigs to only being evaluated against sections with memory permission flags (Read/Write/Execute). This would allow signatures to be evaluated more efficiently and also would decrease the chance of signature false positives.
- Parsing digital signatures in signed MachO exes and evaluating against the certificate trust / block `.crb` rules
- Other features that might be helpful?

As PE, ELF, and MachO parsing features already exist in C, C is the mostly likely language of choice. However any major new self contained code would ideally be written in Rust.

**Category**: Core Development

**What you will learn from this project**:

- The PE, ELF, and MachO file formats
- How ClamAV parses executable headers, performs signature matching, and the capabilities are provided
- How to write ClamAV signatures to match on executable files

**Required skills**:

- Strong C development experience
- Rust development experince (as needed)

### Develop Memory Scanning Capabilities for Unix

Today, ClamAV works by scanning files on disk for malware. It'd be great if ClamAV could also be used to scan process memory on a system its running on in order to detect malware that isn't present on disk.

The ClamAV team is already looking into integrating such a feature from clamav-win32, a project by Gianluigi Tiesi who has graciously agreed to allow us to include this [memory scanning feature](https://github.com/clamwin/clamav-win32/blob/0.102/src/helpers/scanmem.c)  and others in the upstream clamav project.

This project would be to develop a similar capability for use on Linux and/or macOS and/or BSD Unix scanning clients.

As this is a relatively large new feature, an ideal solution would be written in Rust.

**Category**: Fun/Peripheral

**What you will learn from this project**:

- The techniques and OS APIs related to inspecting the memory of running processes
- The security mechanisms in place to limit arbitrary access to process memory

**Required skills**:

- Strong Rust development experience.
- Linux/Unix operating systems experience.

### WebAssembly Runtime

Background: ClamAV has for a long time had runtime support for running portable plugins we call "bytecode signatures". ClamAV has a [custom bytecode compiler](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav-bytecode-compiler) to compile these plugins from a C-like language and uses LLVM or a homegrown "bytecode interpreter" to run the plugins. This solution is strikingly similar to a newer portable plugin technology: WebAssembly!

The goal of project would be to create a proof-of-concept WebAssembly (wasm) runtime in ClamAV so that "wasm signatures" could be written in Rust and executed in a wasm sandbox. As with our current bytecode signature technology, the wasm signatures would run at specific hooks in the ClamAV scanning process. They would need access to the file map (buffer) being scanned, and would be given [a limited API](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/dev/0.103/libclamav/bytecode_api.h) to call into ClamAV functions.

For a proof-of-concept, executing a local wasm plugin that has access to the file being scanned (without copying the data) would be fine. A production solution would need to convert the wasm plugin to an ascii-text encoding so it can be distributed much the same way the current bytecode signature `.cbc` plugins are distributed. As with the bytecode signatures, `clamscan` and `clamd` *must not* load the plugins unless they've been digitally signed or the `--bytecode-unsigned`/`BytecodeUnsigned` options are set, which would disable this safety precaution.

> _Important Notes_: The ClamAV bytecode compiler project is currently undergoing a major re-write. Once complete, the new bytecode compiler will effectively be a Python script that invokes `clang` with a collection of custom compiler passes that effectively compile C code into ClamAV-bytecode plugins. This project would have you extend that project to instead use `rustc` to compile Rust ClamAV-WASM plugins.

### Add Unpacking Support for New Packers

ClamAV includes support for unpacking executables generated by several software packers so that malware can't use them to easily evade detection. The list of packers currently supported can be found in the [Introduction of the ClamAV Manual](../../Introduction.md). There are many packers out there, though, so there is always a need to write unpacking code for ones that are frequently used by malware authors. Some that are currently needed include:

- UPX for ELF
- MPRESS (although we do have some bytecode signatures for MPRESS - those might be sufficient)
- If anyone is interested in this, we can analyze thousands of samples and identify more candidates for this list

Improvements to existing executable (PE/ELF/MachO) parsing code would likely be in C, but any new standalone modules would ideally be written in Rust.

**Category**: Fun/Peripheral

**What you will learn from this project**:

- How packers function, the steps involved in run-time loading and fixing memory maps, and a general approach to unpacking
- You'll gain experience reverse-engineering real-world malware

**Required skills**:

- C development experience.
- Rust development experience.

### Add Support for Matching on .NET Internals

YARA extracts certain properties of .NET executables and makes them available for signatures to use for detection: https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.0/modules/dotnet.html

Can ClamAV do something similar?  For instance, extract the GUIDs and allow matching on those the way we do entries in the PE VersionInfo section?

> _Tip_: An ideal solution for this and any new file parsing feature should be written in Rust and called by our existing C code.

**Category**: Fun/Peripheral

**What you will learn from this project**:

- How .NET executables are structured, and how they work internally
- How to write .NET applications (for testing)
- You'll also test your code against real-world malware, and perform reverse-engineering of samples as needed (if they break your code).

**Required skills**:

- C development experience.
- Rust development experience.
- Any prior experience in the areas listed above is a plus.

### Extract Macros from OXML docs

ClamAV and SigTool currently support parsing OLE Office files to decompress and extract macros for scanning. The newer version OOXML Office files do not have this support, resulting in detection possible for macros in these documents. The ability to both extract and scan macros would enable better coverage. This might mean creating a new target type to prevent creating two signatures one for OLE macros and another for OOXML macros.

> _Tip_: An ideal solution for this and any new file parsing feature should be written in Rust and called by our existing C code.

**Category**:

**What you will learn from this project**:

- ClamAV and SigTool internals
- Office document macro compression (RLE compression)
- Macro storage in OOXML files

- Rust development experience.

### Dynamically add new file types simply by adding file type magic (.ftm) signatures

Known file types are currently baked into each ClamAV versions along with file type magic signatures. See `filetypes_int.h`, `filetypes.h`, and `filetypes.c`. The hardcoded signature definitions for these hardcoded types are generally overridden by `daily.ftm`, a component of `daily.cvd` used to tweak file type identification definitions after release.

This project would be to re-architect how file types are stored in libclamav so new file types can be dynamically added  when `daily.ftm` (or some other `.ftm` file) is loaded. Supplemental `.ftm` files should supplement the existing file type definitions, allowing an `extra.ftm` file to be tested alongside `daily.cvd`.

This new capability when combined with the ability to register bytecode signatures as new file type scanners will dramatically increase the ability to extend ClamAV functionality between major version updates. Even when combined with logical signatures that target specific file types (using the proposed new `Type:` keyword instead of `Target:`, see below project idea), will allow creative analysts to write more compact and efficient logical signatures.

### Register scanners for each file type, Write bytecode "signature" scanners.

Bytecode signatures are the portable executable plugin format for ClamAV. If ClamAV file types each had one or more`*` linked list of file type handlers ("scanners"), then a bytecode API could be added to register a bytecode signature as a new scanner for a file type.

This project should be completed after the project to dynamically add new file types with new file type magic signatures (above). This new scanning architecture would be really powerful way to add features to the product without requiring a major version update. When combined with the project to run WebAssembly signatures written in Rust (project idea above) -- this plugin-based scanner feature would have the potential to become the fastest _and_ **safest** way to add new capabilities to ClamAV.

***Example use case***:

One example use case of this feature would be to alert on the malicious use of crypto miner wallet IDs.

Cryptomining malware has become increasingly prevalent with the rise in cryptocurrency prices, and we have thousands of wallet identifiers known to be associated with malicious cryptomining campaigns. We don't have a robust way of using these IDs for detection, though, because we only want to raise an alert if the ID appears to be used in a malicious way (Ex: hardcoded into a mining application or as part of a coin miner configuration file) and not in legitimate ways (Ex: blog posts about campaigns or wallet block lists used by the mining pools).

The two use-cases that we want to alert on are miner config files and executables with the embedded wallet identifier. We could have two `.ftm` rules (one for each case) that indicate a `CL_TYPE_MINER` or something like that, and then scanning execution for `CL_TYPE_MINER` can go to the bytecode sig to perform any other checks that may be necessary.

***`*`Additional Considerations***: ClamAV has several locations in the scanning process for invoking file type scanners:
1. After initial file type identification, and before the "raw scan". In `cli_magic_scan()`.
2. Once for each embedded file types found when using `scanraw()` to also match on embedded type recognition signatures`*`. In `scanraw()`.
   - `*`Embedded type recognition signature matching is a feature used to identify self-extracting archives and some harder to identify file formats, like XML-based office document formats, DMG files, master boot records (MBR), etc. It isn't used for some archive and disk image formats that we'll unpack later anyways because they cause excessive type false positives and duplicate file scanning. A common example without this safety measure was duplicate file extraction and scanning of zip file entries found in a tarball.
3. After scanning all of the found embedded types (above). At the end of `scanraw()`. These could probably be moved to (4) if it is deemed safe to remove the 1st "safety measure" call to `scanraw()` in `cli_magic_scan()` (i.e we'd only call `scanraw()` once, ever).
4. Again, after the call to `scanraw()` at the bottom of `cli_magic_scan()`, for types that have bytecode hooks that won't execute unless a logical signature matches, requiring `scanraw()` to perform matching first.

Considering that there are 3 or 4 placement options for scanners, it may be required to have 3 (or 4) different lists to add to when registering a new scanner to indicate when to run the scanner in the scanning process. An enum argument for the function would indicate which list to add it to. If inserting the new scanner for a given type from the _front_ of the list, and only invoking the next scanner if the first one returns `CL_EPARSE` or `CL_EFORMAT`, then a scanner registration could be used to override an existing/built-in one _or_ supplement it, whichever is desired.

This project would would require coming up with a common file-type-scanner API for all scanners (including bytecode scanners), and would enable moving all file-type-scanners out of `scanners.c` and into a new file for each in a `scanners` subdirectory. A separate `parsers` subdirectory should be added at this time and each file type parser would be moved there. The distinction between a "scanner" and a "parser" is this. A scanner uses a parser to extract bits to be scanned. A parser may simply be something like an archive extraction library. In some cases, particularly in internally developed code, the distinction may be less clear and so the entire thing may be better placed under the `scanners` directory as the entry-point will doubtless need to use the common file-type-scanner API.

This project will also require creating lots of regression tests for file type identification to ensure that the new architecture doesn't accidentally misclassify or fail to scan certain files.

The majority of the work won't actually change ClamAV's behavior, which may seem frustrating, but the end goal is super cool. Code cleanup and organization along the way will also make a meaningful difference. This project could be split into pieces:

  1. Establish a common file type scanner function API and reorganize the scanners and parsers as described above.
  2. Convert the API into a callback function pointer definition and create a registration API. Add a set of scanner callback lists to each file type. The built-in scanners should be initialized either at compile time or at least when libclamav is initialized, depending on the chosen design.

### Limit logical signature alerts based on file type

ClamAV signatures have a "Target Type" which is an integer type which can be used in signatures to limit signature matches to specific file types. ClamAV also categorizes signature patterns into two different Aho-Corasick pattern-matching trie's by Target Type. Target Type `1` (Windows executables (EXE/DLL/SYS/etc.) go in one trie, and _everything else_ goes in the other trie. Unfortunately, not every file type has an associated target type. In addition, while it's conceivable to be able to add new text-based file types dynamically (see the above project idea about file type magic signatures), it is less feasible to dynamically add new numerical target types.

For some advanced reading, see:
 - [File Types](../../appendix/FileTypes.md)
 - [Logical Signatures](../Signatures/LogicalSignatures.md)

This project is to add a new "`FileTypes:`" keyword to the `TargetDescriptionBlock` for [Logical Signature (`.ldb`)](../Signatures/LogicalSignatures.md) to limit logical signature alerts to specific file types, much like you currently can do with Target Types ("`Target:`"), Container File Types ("`Container:`"), and Container Intermediate Types ("`Intermediates:`"). While this isn't expected to improve scan times, it should reduce overall signature size as analysts will no longer need to duplicate the file-type-magic signature in order to limit alerting on a signature match by file type.

To illustrate, this is the file type magic signature for a Microsoft Shortcut File, aka `CL_TYPE_LNK`:

```
0:0:4C0000000114020000000000C000000000000046:Microsoft Windows Shortcut File:CL_TYPE_ANY:CL_TYPE_LNK:100
```

Though we can classify a file as `CL_TYPE_LNK` and even unpack the file with custom scanner using that type, there is presently no way to write a signature for `CL_TYPE_LNK` files without duplicating the `0:4C0000000114020000000000C000000000000046` bit.

At present a signature to alert on a "malicious" shortcut containing `0xdeadbeef` might look like this:

```
SignatureName;Target:0;(0&1);0:4C0000000114020000000000C000000000000046;deadbeef
```

After this change, the signature could instead read:

```
SignatureName;Target:0,FileTypes:CL_TYPE_LNK;(0);deadbeef
```

Extending this, we would really like to build this new option to replace "Container" and "Intermediates". We would like to also specify parent file types, and use a logical condition supporting alternative file types for each layer.

Some examples:

`Filetypes:(ZIP|RAR)>PDF`  to say "a PDF in a ZIP or a RAR"

`Filetypes:(ZIP|RAR)>(PDF|HTML)`  to say "a PDF or HTML file in a ZIP or a RAR"

`Filetypes:EML>ZIP>*`  to say "any file in a ZIP in an email"

### libclamav Callback Function to Request Additional File

Add a callback function to give libclamav file parsers the ability to request additional file data from the scanning application -- I.e. `clamscan` and `clamd` (and by extension `clamdscan` & `clamonacc`).

This feature would enable support for split-archive scans, if all components of the split archive are present and available to the scanning application. To make this work for `clamdscan`+`clamd`, or `clamonacc`+`clamd`, the request would also have to be relayed by `clamd` over the socket API to the scanning client, and the client would have to respond with additional data, filepath, or file descriptor for `clamd` to provide via the callback to file parser.

> **Disclaimer**: It's entirely likely that this idea is bogus and wouldn't work over the `clamd`+`clamdscan` socket API. This task would require a fair amount exploratory coding.

When a file is scanned, the scanner (eg `cli_scanrar`) may call a callback function provided by clamscan or clamd to request scan access to other files by name, with the expectation that it would receive an `fmap` in response. Specifically, when the first file in a split archive is scanned, the parser could request `fmap`s for subsequent files to provide to the archive extraction library. Direct scanning of files other than the first file in a split archive will skip, because they are split and are not the first file.
