# Uninstalling ClamAV

## If you installed from source

```bash
./configure

sudo make uninstall
```

## If you installed from packages

* Debian:

  `dpkg --remove clamav*`

* Redhat/Fedora:

  `yum remove clamav*`

* Mandriva:

  `urpme clamav`

* Gentoo:

  `emerge -C clamav`

* FreeBSD:

  `pkg delete clamav`

* OpenBSD:

  `pkg_delete clamav`

* NetBSD:

  `pkgin remove clamav`

* Slackware:

  `/etc/rc.d/rc.clamav stop; removepkg clamav`

## Caveats

Make sure that you havenâ€™t got old libraries (_libclamav.so_) lying around your filesystem. You can verify it using:

```bash
ldd `which freshclam`
```

Also make sure there is really only one version of ClamAV installed on your system:

```bash
whereis freshclam

whereis clamscan
```
