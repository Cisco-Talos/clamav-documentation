# Malware and False Positive Report FAQ

## How long does it take for a signature change after submitting new malware or submitting a false positive report?

In most cases, it takes at least 48 hours from initial submission before any change will be published in the official ClamAV signature databases.

## Who analyzes malware and false positive file uploads?

Given the volume of submissions, the vast majority of files are handled by automation.

## Who has access to the uploaded files?

Access is limited to engineers and analysts within the Cisco Talos organization.

## Are malware or false positive file uploads shared with other companies?

No. Files that are submitted through the [Malware web form](https://www.clamav.net/reports/malware), [False Positive web form](https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp), or using the `clamsubmit` tool, are not shared outside of Cisco.

However, sample sharing is fair game if we have already received the same file from a different source (VirusTotal, various feeds, etc.).

## Are the files deleted after the analysis?

No. Uploaded files are kept indefinitely.

## Is the file accessible using a public URL at any point in this process?

No. Uploaded files are not accessible using a public URL. They are processed internally and kept internal to Cisco Talos.
