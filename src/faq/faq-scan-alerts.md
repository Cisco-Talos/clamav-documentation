# Interpreting Scan Alerts FAQ

## ClamAV alerted on a file during a scan. What do I do?

ClamAV may have found a malicious or suspicious file. However, you're probably asking yourself if the alert is a False Positive (FP). It may well be, so don't just delete the file out-of-hand.

### Online Research

First, consider the file itself and whether or not the alert makes sense. If you're concerned, start by searching the name of the signature on Google. If FP's are being reported, you may see others complaining about the same thing, or you may be able to get an understanding of what the signature is trying to find.

### Technical Investigation

Second, if you're technically inclined, you may want to try to read the signature details to understand how it works and what, specifically, it's alerting on. Take heed, this investigation might leave you more confused than when you started. ClamAV doesn't post write-ups on how each signature in-part because a good number of our signatures these days are generated automatically and not by a human mind.

1. Start by opening a command prompt in a new empty directory, for example:

    ```bash
    user@laptop:~$  mkdir /tmp/sigdump

    user@laptop:~$  cd /tmp/sigdump
    ```

2. Use the `sigtool` program to unpack the ClamAV databases into their separate components. SigTool should be installed alongside clamscan, probably in `/usr/local/bin/sigtool`. The ClamAV databases are traditionally installed in `/usr/local/share/clamav` although if you installed from a package manager, your paths may vary:

    ```bash
    user@laptop:/tmp/sigdump$  sigtool -u /usr/local/share/clamav/main.cvd

    user@laptop:/tmp/sigdump$  sigtool -u /usr/local/share/clamav/daily.cvd        # May be: daily.cld

    user@laptop:/tmp/sigdump$  sigtool -u /usr/local/share/clamav/bytecode.cvd     # May be: bytecode.cld
    ```

3. Use `ls` to verify that you've successfully unpacked the databases:

    ```bash
    user@laptop:/tmp/sigdump$  ls

    ```

4. Use `grep` to search for the signature in question. For example:

    ```bash
    user@laptop:/tmp/sigdump$  grep -r Win.Downloader.DDECmdExec-6683887-5

    Win.Downloader.DDECmdExec-6683887-5;Engine:81-255,Target:0;4;0:1f8b;0:255044462d;0:4d5a{-100}50450000;7c27{-255}2721;(0=0&1=0&2=0)&3/(?<!\x20)[=+\-@]\s*?(\w+\s*?\x28)?.{0,50}(certutil|cmd|cmstp|cscript|dnscmd|msiexec|netsh|regsvr32|rpcping|rundll32|schtasks|telnet|tscon|tsdiscon|wmic|wscript).{0,50}\|\s*?\x27[^\x27]{5,255}\x27\s*?\x21/i
    ```

5. Reading ClamAV signatures is hard. You can familiarize yourself with the ClamAV signature format by reading the documentation on [writing ClamAV Signatures](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/dev/0.101/docs/UserManual/Signatures.md#introduction).

    To get a jump start, you can make `sigtool` print out a more human readable represenation of what the signature is looking for. Pipe the output from grep directly into sigtool by using the `--decode-sigs` option:

    ```bash
    user@laptop:/tmp/sigdump$  grep Win.Downloader.DDECmdExec-6683887-5 -r . | ../../bin/sigtool --decode-sigs
    ```

    The output will look something like this:

    ```bash
        VIRUS NAME: ./daily.ldb:Win.Downloader.DDECmdExec-6683887-5
        TDB: Engine:81-255,Target:0
        LOGICAL EXPRESSION: 4
         * SUBSIG ID 0
         +-> OFFSET: 0
         +-> SIGMOD: NONE
         +-> DECODED SUBSIGNATURE:
        ï¿½
         * SUBSIG ID 1
         +-> OFFSET: 0
         +-> SIGMOD: NONE
         +-> DECODED SUBSIGNATURE:
        %PDF-
         * SUBSIG ID 2
         +-> OFFSET: 0
         +-> SIGMOD: NONE
         +-> DECODED SUBSIGNATURE:
        MZ{WILDCARD_ANY_STRING(LENGTH<=100)}PE
         * SUBSIG ID 3
         +-> OFFSET: ANY
         +-> SIGMOD: NONE
         +-> DECODED SUBSIGNATURE:
        |'{WILDCARD_ANY_STRING(LENGTH<=255)}'!
         * SUBSIG ID 4
         +-> OFFSET: ANY
         +-> SIGMOD: NONE
         +-> DECODED SUBSIGNATURE:
             +-> TRIGGER: (0=0&1=0&2=0)&3
             +-> REGEX: (?<!\x20)[=+\-@]\s*?(\w+\s*?\x28)?.{0,50}(certutil|cmd|cmstp|cscript|dnscmd|msiexec|netsh|regsvr32|rpcping|rundll32|schtasks|telnet|tscon|`tsdiscon|wmic|wscript).{0,50}\|\s*?\x27[^\x27]{5,255}\x27\s*?\x21
             +-> CFLAGS: i
    ```

6. Interpret the results. ClamAV signatures can be as simple as a hash-based signature of a known-malicious file, but they can also be a complex logical test. You may not learn enough to make an educated decision. The above example is a pretty complicated one, so I will try to walk you through it.

    You can see that there are 5 subsignatures (numbered 0 - 4). The `LOGICICAL EXPRESSION` indicates which subsignature(s) matter and why. This could be something like `0 AND 1` to indicate that 2 subsignatures must both trigger in order for the overall signature to alert. In this case, only subsignature `4` is required by the `LOGICAL EXPRESSION`.

    If you look at `SUBSIG ID 4`, you'll see that has a has a `TRIGGER` which acts in much the same way as the above `LOGICAL EXPRESSION`. If the subsignatures in the logical expression are satisfied, then the regular expression `REGEX` will be tested. If the regular expression matches, then the SUBSIG ID 4 will trigger and the overall signature will alert.

### Reporting

If you believe that the signature alerted on a benign file, please report the False Positive so our analysts can refine or remove the faulty signature. You can report false positives [on our website](https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp) or you can submit the report using the `clamsubmit` command-line program.

If you're concerned that the file may be malicious, and aren't comfortable quarantining and/or deleting the file, feel free to ask in the user mailing lists for advice. Please subscribe to [clamav-users](https://lists.clamav.net/mailman/listinfo/) and then post a message to all the list members by sending an email to clamav-users -at- lists -dot- clamav -dot- net.
