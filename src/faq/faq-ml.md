# Mailing Lists FAQ

## Where can I ask questions about using ClamAV?

Subscribe to our [clamav-users] mailing-list.

## I want to take part to the development of ClamAV. Where can I get more info?

Subscribe to the [clamav-devel] mailing-list.

## The mailing-lists generate too many messages per day. I can't handle them. What shall I do?

There are two possible solutions:

- Go to the [mailing-list] mailman interface, click on __Unsubscribe or edit options__, and turn _digest mode_ on.
- Access the mailing-lists using a "news reader".

## I sent a message to one of ClamAV's mailing-lists, but the mail was rejected/held for approval. Why?

Only subscribers are allowed to post to the mailing-list. This is done to avoid spammers.

## I read the mailing-list from the Gmane news gateway. Can I post to the mailing-list?

See previous FAQ.

## I've been unsubscribed from one of the mailing-lists. What happened?

There are two possible reasons: If your account generates too many bounces you'll be automatically unsubscribed.  Please subscribe again with a more reliable account. If we receive even one _out of office notification_ from your vacation program,  your address will be unsubscribed and banned from our mailing-lists forever.  Sorry for that, there are just too many stupid people out there.

## How do I disable mail delivery from the mailing-list I'm subscribed to?

Suppose you are subscribed to [clamav-users]. Go to [clamav-users] and enter your mail address at the bottom of the page. Click on __Unsubscribe or edit options__. At the next page enter your password and press _Log in_. Under _Your clamav-users Subscription Options_ choose _Disabled_ opposite _Mail delivery_ and press _Submit My Changes_ at the bottom of the page.
